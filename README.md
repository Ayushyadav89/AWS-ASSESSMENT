# AWS_Assessment - Prepared Terraform templates & README templates
This repository contains Terraform templates, README templates, and scripts for completing the AWS assessment tasks. **I cannot access your AWS account** or take screenshots; you must run the Terraform and capture the screenshots yourself. Replace the variable `prefix` with `FirstName_Lastname` before deploying.

Folders:
- Q1_Networking_Subnetting
- Q2_EC2_Static_Website
- Q3_HA_AutoScaling_ALB
- Q4_Billing_Alerts
- Q5_DrawIO_Diagram

See individual README.md files in each folder for task-specific instructions.
